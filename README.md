# Data for "Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor" 


This is super-preliminary and not public yet, as it's buggy! So please
be careful and tread lightly. 


Available: 
- [ ] Connectivty 
- [ ] main timeseries
- [ ] output images / frames for above timeseries
- [ ] lesion data
- [ ] memory IO 

Basic explanations of the data can be found in the ipython
notebooks included in this project. 


All data is stored in s3, and the files are massive.
